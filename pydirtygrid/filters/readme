Added by Weichen Wang, May 2017, to generate photometry output for WISE bands.

Filter response curve for WISE bands, defined as response per photon. 
First column: wavelength
Second column: response
Third column: error function (parts in thousand)
Currently adopted from http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/WISE/passbands.html
Need to crosscheck with official data, and unify the format (to FAST/EAZY style)
